## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-17

Initial public release.

- Add explicit simple, language-tagged, and typed literal constructors.
- Add syntax-independent RDF term and triple structure validation.
- Preserve document-local blank-node identity across in-memory and streaming parser calls.
- Add stable, allocation-free messages for every public error enum.
- Reject invalid negative reader limits instead of silently applying defaults.
